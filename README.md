# Identify_Customer_Segments

In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information 
about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. 
Youâ€™ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers 
are in each of the segments obtained.

Project Overview:
In this project, I've worked with real-life data provided to us by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. 
The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of 
the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 
The job as a data scientist will be to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters,
then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods,
it will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

NumPy

pandas

Sklearn / scikit-learn

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Seaborn (for data visualization)

The unsupervised learning branch of machine learning is key in the organization of large and complex datasets. While unsupervised learning lies in contrast 
to supervised learning in the fact that unsupervised learning lacks objective output classes or values, it can still be important in converting the data 
into a form that can be used in a supervised learning task. Dimensionality reduction techniques can help surface the main signals and 
associations in your data, providing supervised learning techniques a more focused set of features upon which to apply their work. 
Clustering techniques are useful for understanding how the data points themselves are organized. These clusters might themselves be 
a useful feature in a directed supervised learning task.
